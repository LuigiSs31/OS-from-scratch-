# Basic Operating System
## A Basic x86 Operating System



This repository contains the source code for a minimal, "from-scratch" x86 operating system. This was developed as the final project for the Operating Systems class at Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara.

The primary goal of this project was not to create a full-featured OS, but to learn and demonstrate the fundamental concepts of how an operating system boots and interacts with hardware.

##  Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the excellent **"How to make an OS in C" tutorial** by Carlos Fenollosa (@cfenollosa). The structure, step-by-step guidance, and explanations provided in that tutorial were the primary resource for this project.

  * **Original Tutorial Repository:** [github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)

Our work involved following this tutorial, writing and understanding every line of code, and adapting it to meet our project goals.
